        <h2>Procedure For Cooking Jollof Rice</h2>
        <p>
            The jollof rice recipe discussed here is a Nigerian recipe. For years there has
            been a serious debate between Nigeria and Ghana about who cooks the best Jollof rice, 
            but I believe it depends on the experience of the cook preparing the dish.

            <li>
                Cook the chicken with thyme, knorr cubes, and 2 chopped bulbs of onions. When done,
                grill it in an oven or fry it.
            </li>
            <li>Parboil the rice and put in a sieve to drain.</li>
            <li>Pour the chicken stock and tomato stew into a pot and leave to boil.</li>
            <li>Add the drained parboiled rice, curry powder, salt and pepper to taste.
                Add water and ensure the water level is the same level of the rice.</li>

                Cook till it is done. If the rice was parboiled, 
                it should be ready once the water has dried.
