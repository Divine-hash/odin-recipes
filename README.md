# odin-recipes
This project is a basic HTML only recipe website. After completing this project, I understood how 
links (both relative and absolute) work, how to organise files, how to embed images on a web page, how to make use of ordered and unordered lists, and using the heading tags. I eccountered a promblem when I couldn't write a fraction on my page, but I did my research and discovered I could write fractions in my page a HTML entity.
